# Validation

Laravel provides several different approaches to validate your application's incoming data. By default, Laravel's base controller class uses a ValidatesRequests trait which provides a 
convenient method to validate incoming HTTP request with a variety of powerful validation rules.

Both `unique` and `exists` validation rules, require the database to be queried. This packages provides this integration.

## Unique

The field under validation must be unique for a given Entity. If the column option is not specified, the field name will be used.

|Parameter| Description|
|--|--|
| **entity** | fully qualified namespace of your entity |
| **column** | the column that should be unqiue |
| **exceptId** | the id that should be excluded from the query [optional] |
| **idColumn** | alternative id column (defaults to id) [optional] |
   
```php
/**
 * Store a new blog post.
 *
 * @param  Request  $request
 * @return Response
 */
public function store(Request $request)
{
    $this->validate($request, [
        'username' => 'required|unique:App\Entities\User,username',
    ]);
}
```

### Forcing A Unique Rule To Ignore A Given ID:

Sometimes, you may wish to ignore a given ID during the unique check. For example, consider an "update profile" screen that includes the user's name, e-mail address, and location. Of course, you will want to verify that the e-mail address is unique. However, if the user only changes the name field and not the e-mail field, you do not want a validation error to be thrown because the user is already the owner of the e-mail address. You only want to throw a validation error if the user provides an e-mail address that is already used by a different user. To tell the unique rule to ignore the user's ID, you may pass the ID as the third parameter:

```
'email' => 'unique:users,email_address,'.$user->id
```

### Adding Additional Where Clauses:

You may also specify more conditions that will be added as "where" clauses to the query:

```
'email' => 'unique:users,email_address,NULL,id,account_id,1'
```

In the rule above, only rows with an account_id of 1 would be included in the unique check.


## Exists

The field under validation must exist on a given database table.

|Parameter| Description|
|--|--|
| **entity** | fully qualified namespace of your entity |
| **column** | the column that should be unqiue |
| **exceptId** | the id that should be excluded from the query [optional] |
| **idColumn** | alternative id column (defaults to id) [optional] |
   
```php
/**
 * Store a new blog post.
 *
 * @param  Request  $request
 * @return Response
 */
public function update($id, Request $request)
{
    $this->validate($request, [
        'username' => 'required|exists:App\Entities\User,username',
    ]);
}
```
